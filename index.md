## About Me

I'm an undergraduate student at Soochow University(PRC) major in Bioinformatics/Computational Biology since 2017. 

Currently, I am working on programming and have a thirst for the insight of mathematic modeling, modern statistic and pattern recognition. My involvement in science lays in the study of the effect of mutations on protein 3D structure.
